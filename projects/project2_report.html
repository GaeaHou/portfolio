        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Used a tight Y-axis range to emphasize small differences in gender enrollment rates, making convergence toward parity more visually apparent. (Score: -1, mildly deceptive)</li>
          <li>Focused only on primary education (excluding secondary levels) to highlight the near-equal opportunity in early schooling. (Score: -0.5, slightly deceptive)</li>
          <li>Combined a world map with the trend line chart to create an impression of global consistency and progress. (Score: +2, highly earnest)</li>
          <li>Applied neutral green and yellow color tones to avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes and focus purely on the data trend. (Score: +2, highly earnest)</li>
          <li>Annotated final year values explicitly on the trend line to highlight the small remaining gender gap and reinforce the message. (Score: +1, mostly earnest)</li>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>
      
        <ul>
          <li>Selected only the five countries with the worst gender gaps to exaggerate the severity of secondary education inequality. (Score: -1.5, deceptive)</li>
          <li>Used a contrasting color scheme (red for female, blue for male) to evoke emotional reactions and reinforce perceived inequalities. (Score: -1, deceptive)</li>
          <li>Added a reference line for global male average enrollment but omitted a global female average reference. (Score: -1, deceptive)</li>
          <li>Placed a clean, tight table next to the chart summarizing individual country gaps and the global average gap, enhancing credibility and quantitative framing. (Score: +2, earnest)</li>
          <li>Maintained a truthful Y-axis scale from 0% to 100%, ensuring proportional honesty of enrollment differences. (Score: +2, earnest)</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      
        <p>
          This project revealed how selective visual framing can significantly influence audience perceptions even when based on the same underlying dataset.  
          In the FOR visualization, I focused on primary school enrollment rates, where gender gaps have largely closed, using neutral color schemes and tight scales to emphasize convergence.  
          In the AGAINST visualization, I deliberately shifted focus to lower secondary enrollment, highlighting areas where gender disparities persist, supported by emotionally charged color choices and selective sampling.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          What surprised me most was how natural it felt to construct both persuasive narratives without altering the data itself — merely by changing which parts to emphasize and how to present them.  
          The most revealing insight was realizing that the very definition of "basic education" can be used rhetorically: by separating primary and secondary levels, it became possible to argue simultaneously that "we've succeeded" and "we're failing" within the same system.  
          This duality underscores that ethical visualization is not only about representing data truthfully, but also about explicitly disclosing segmentation choices that might shape audience interpretation.  
          Ethical persuasive visualization demands not only honesty in data, but also transparency in framing decisions, ensuring viewers are aware of the context and limitations behind what they see.
